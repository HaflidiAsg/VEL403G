<b>Assignment 1</b>
   <ul>
        1. Use a design software to make something that could not be made subtractively, and 3D print your design
        2. 3D scan something with photogrammetry
        3. Document the process and upload your design files
   </ul>

<b>Assignment completion checklist</b>
   <ul>
        1. Have you explained what you made and how it would not be possible to do with a substractive process
        2. Have you described what you learned by testing/using the 3D printer
        3. Have you outlined problems you encountered and how you fixed them
        4. Have you 3D scanned an object and described limitations to the approach
        5. Have you described what you learned by 3D scanning a model
        6. Have you included your design files and your scanned files
        7. Have you included a hero shot of your 3D printed object
   </ul>
