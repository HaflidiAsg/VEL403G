<b>Assignment - Molding and casting</b>
   <ul>
        1. Use a CAD software to build a multy dimensional negative of a negative
        2. Mill the mold using relevant stock using rough cut + finish cut
        3. Cast the mold with silicone
        4. Cast the final parts
   </ul>
   
<b>Assignment completion checklist</b>
   <ul>
        1. Have you made your own model and documented the design principles
        2. Have you described problems and how you fixed them
        3. Have you shown how you made the mold and eventually the cast
        4. Have you included design files and hero shots
   </ul>
   
Estimated FAQ:
   <ul>
        1. What materials can I use? 
            A: We will use wax as millable stock, silicone for first cast and f.x. epoxy resin or gipsum for final cast.
        2. How much time does it take to machine?
            A: Expect 5 hour after all design files are ready.
        3. How can I make sure my design files are ready?
            A: Hafli√∞i and Arnar will review CAD files prior to booking a time slot in the lab with TA
